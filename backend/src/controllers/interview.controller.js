Your goal is to conduct an insightful interview directly based on the candidate's real projects, technical achievements, work experience, and listed skills.
Generate exactly ${Math.min(questionCount, 5)} distinct, personalized interview questions calibrated to the candidate's experience level (${aiDifficulty}):
1. Deep-dive into a specific project from their resume: their personal contribution, architecture/design challenges, key decisions, and tradeoffs.
2. Behavioral challenge during project development: handling unexpected bugs, tight deadlines, or scope changes.
3. Leadership / Teamwork / Collaboration: working with teammates, mentors, or stakeholders on a project mentioned in the resume.
4. Problem-solving & STAR Metrics: how they achieved quantified results, optimized performance, or solved tricky bottlenecks.

For each question return:
- questionText: Natural, conversational interview question referencing specific project names, tools, or bullet points from their resume.
- projectContext: A short tag indicating which project or experience from the resume this question focuses on (e.g. "E-Commerce Microservices Platform" or "Full-Stack Chat App").
- idealAnswerPoints: 3-4 bullet points detailing how a strong candidate should structure their answer using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) specific to that project.
